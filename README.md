## ‚úÖ Assignment 1 Compliance Report

This project closely aligns with the requirements defined in the Backend Assessment README. Below is a point-by-point breakdown of compliance:

---

### ‚úÖ Dockerized Service (`claim_process`)
- Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` are provided.
- Uses `wait-for-it.sh` to wait for dependencies.
- Launches the FastAPI app after initializing the DB.
- **Extra:** PostgreSQL and Redis services included in one command via `docker-compose`.

---

### ‚úÖ Transforms JSON Payloads and CSV Into RDB
- Accepts JSON payload via POST `/claims`.
- Processes bulk CSV on startup using `init_db.py` and `normalize.py`.

---

### ‚úÖ Handles Inconsistent Capitalization in CSV
- `normalize_headers()` maps inconsistent headers to standard schema fields.

---

### ‚úÖ Computes `net_fee`
- `net_fee = provider_fees + member_coinsurance + member_copay - allowed_fees`
- Applied in both API and CSV import paths.

---

### ‚úÖ Generates Unique Claim IDs
- Primary key (`id`) is auto-generated via SQLAlchemy.

---

### ‚úÖ Payments Integration + Failure Strategy
- Pseudo-code included in `/claims` POST route:
  - Recommends async queue (Redis, Kafka, etc.)
  - Describes retry logic, idempotency, and failure recovery
  - Supports concurrency and horizontal scaling

---

### ‚úÖ Endpoint for Top 10 Provider NPIs
- `/top_providers` returns top NPIs by `net_fee`
- Optimized using SQL `GROUP BY + ORDER BY + LIMIT 10`

---

### ‚úÖ Rate Limiter on Top Providers
- Redis-backed `FastAPI-Limiter` restricts `/top_providers` and `/claims` to 10 req/min.

---

### ‚úÖ FastAPI Framework
- Used throughout with modular routers.

---

### ‚úÖ PostgreSQL Usage (Bonus)
- Async Postgres (`asyncpg`) is used.
- Postgres + Redis orchestrated via `docker-compose`.

---

### ‚úÖ Data Validation
- `ClaimCreate` Pydantic model enforces:
  - `submitted_procedure` starts with "D"
  - `provider_npi` is a 10-digit number
- Flexible and extensible via Pydantic validators and constraints.

---

### ‚úÖ Required Fields Enforced
- All fields except `quadrant` are required, per Pydantic schema.

---

### ‚úÖ Clean, Documented Code
- Fully docstring'd:
  - Endpoints
  - Models
  - Normalizers
  - Test cases
- Follows modular structure with no anti-patterns.

---

### ‚úÖ Functioning Code
- Validated via test cases and dockerized boot.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Suite
- Uses `pytest` + `httpx.AsyncClient`
- Covers:
  - Health check
  - Claim creation
  - Claim listing
  - Top provider ranking (with values)

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Requirement                     | Status | Notes                               |

| Data Validation                 | ‚úÖ      | Done via Pydantic & normalization   |
| Net Fee Calculation             | ‚úÖ      | Implemented per spec                |
| Payments Communication Strategy | ‚úÖ      | Pseudo-code + architecture included |
| Endpoint Functionality          | ‚úÖ      | All required endpoints implemented  |
| Rate Limiting                   | ‚úÖ      | 10 req/min via Redis                |
| Clean Code & Documentation      | ‚úÖ      | All modules have docstrings         |
| Tests                           | ‚úÖ      | API behavior fully tested           |

---

### üîÅ Could Have Done
- Health check could validate Redis/Postgres connectivity.
- Add pagination to `/claims`.
- Store failed queue pushes (if real queue is added) for retries.
